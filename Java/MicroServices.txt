Small set of services easy to build and deploy that interact with each other via REST

Benefit: 
	- Scalable: as small parts exist and each can scale independently.
		(e.g. just like Java storm bolts can scale up independently)

Cons:
	- In a single process the communication between APIs is straight forward.
